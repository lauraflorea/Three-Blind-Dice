# Three-Blind-Dice

A self-developed dice probability game complete with dice rolling animations, menu, and outcome scoring storage and display. 


## Aim of the Game
The goal of the player is to roll as many of their “number to get” while simultaneously avoiding the “number to avoid”. 

Even if the player’s roll produces one instance of the number they chose to avoid in any case, this will result in a loss. 

A “neutral number” (number not chosen by the player) will affect the player positively if rolled when “number to avoid” does not show up, and will mitigate the effects of the “number to avoid” if it is rolled. 

### Instructions: 
1. The player chooses a number from 1 - 6 which they would like to end up with on the dice. This will be the “number to get”. 
2. The player then chooses another number which differs from the first number chosen which they want to avoid on the three dice they roll. This will be the “number to avoid”.  
3. The player either inputs these numbers into the program and rolls the virtual dice, or rolls 3 actual dice. 
4. The player will either make a profit, lose money, or break even based on the outcome they roll.
